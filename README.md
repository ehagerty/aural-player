## Update (May 7, 2021)

Since I do not have access to M1 hardware, and my hardware is unable to run macOS Big Sur in it current unusable state, I will not be pushing out any further updates to Aural Player for the time being, at least not any updates relevant to Big Sur or M1 hardware.

I leave it as an exercise for those interested to get Aural Player ready to run on M1 hardware. This will require building universal ffmpeg shared libraries that are capable of running on both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.

## Overview

Aural Player is an audio player for macOS. Inspired by the classic Winamp player for Windows, it is designed to be easy to use and customizable, with support for a wide variety of popular audio formats and powerful sound tuning capabilities for audio enthusiasts.

#### Goals:
* To have a simple drag-drop-play player for the music collection on your local drives, that is able to play a wide variety of audio formats.
* To *allow* customization/configuration, but not to *require* it out of the box.
* To make sound tuning an integral part of the listening experience and to have it within quick and easy reach at all times.
* To have a decent macOS Winamp counterpart.

#### Limitations:
* Does not play protected content (e.g. Apple's M4P or Audible's AAX).
* No streaming / scrobbling, etc.

### Important note for macOS Big Sur

If you're on macOS Big Sur, you must download v2.3.0 or later versions. No older app versions will run on macOS Big Sur.

### Important note for anyone upgrading from v2.2.0 (or older) to v2.3.0 or newer app versions

In order to circumvent the hassle of macOS security restrictions, the location where the app stores its persisted state has changed from *~/Documents* to *~/Music*. This means that if you are upgrading from an older version of Aural Player (v2.2.0 or older), you need to move your app state directory from *~/Documents* to *~/Music* (exact steps listed below). Otherwise, note that you will lose all your previously saved app settings (playlist, sound settings, favorites, history, color schemes, window layouts, etc).

Perform the following simple steps when upgrading from v2.2.0 or any older version to v2.3.0 or any newer version.

* Quit Aural Player v2.2.0 (or any older app version) if it is running.
* Move the folder named ***aural*** in your user's *Documents* folder, to your user's *Music* folder.
* Download/install Aural Player v2.3.0 (or any newer app version) and run it.
* Verify that your previous app settings have been carried over to the new version - playlist tracks, window layouts, color schemes, history, favorites, bookmarks, etc. If not, please file an issue, and I will help you restore your previous app settings (this should not happen, but just in case).

The contents of the "aural" folder should look like this:

![aural app state folder screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maculateConception/aural-player/master/Documentation/Screenshots/auralDir2.png)

### Installation

1. Mount the **AuralPlayer-x.y.z.dmg** image file
2. From within the mounted image, copy **Aural.app** to your local drive (e.g. Applications folder)
3. Run the copy from your local drive. You will likely see a security warning and the app will not open because the app's developer is not recognized by macOS.
4. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Open anyway**, to allow Aural.app to open.

NOTE - Please ***don't*** run the app directly from within the image. It is a compressed image, and may result in the app behaving slowly and/or unpredictably. So, copy it outside and run the copy.

### Enabling media keys support (optional)

Follow the steps listed [here](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player/wiki/Enabling-media-keys-support)

## Known issues

### 1 - The text is too small (not readable) on my high resolution Mac screen.

The fix for this is easy. 

#### On v2.5.0 or newer versions: 

Go to the menu **View > Font scheme > Customize**, and either increase the font sizes of the various UI textual elements, and/or choose different font faces, per your preference.

#### On v2.4.0 or older versions: 

Go to the menu **View > Text Size**, and choose the ***Larger*** or ***Largest*** text size preset, per your preference.

### 2 - Bad audio quality when connecting Bluetooth headphones

If you notice poor audio quality when you first connect Bluetooth headphones, try the following:

**Fix# 1 - Set your system's input device to the built-in device**

When you connect Bluetooth headphones to your Mac, if your headphones have a microphone, the OS will typically switch to using your Bluetooth microphone as its input device. Simply go to **System Preferences > Sound > Input**, and change the input device back to your Mac's built-in input device.

This should fix the problem. If not, try Fix# 2.

**Fix# 2 - Change your system's Bluetooth audio codec settings**
